# HEA
This project focuses on high entropy alloys.
Done: 
We have built a random forest (RF) machine learning model to predict the phases (five phase) in HEA, reaching an accuracy of 94.6%. 
In progress: 
We have beening now working on the short range order (SRO) in some HEAs. Here for the first one we focus on CrNiCo HEAs. 
We found some interesting things for the distributions of Cr ions, for which the SRO still exists at high temperature (as high as 1000K).
